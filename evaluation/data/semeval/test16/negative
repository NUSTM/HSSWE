thursday is thor's day and i'm sore from the thunder of stress that i'm under

curtis is right : #sjsharks forwards coasting back to the d zone is not a formula for success . 3rd line didn't distinguish itself there .
i may well need therapy for what that guy just did to one of my all time favourite david bowie songs ... wtf was that !!! #xfactorliveshows
tfi friday was good in the 90s because it was new and chris evans was young . someone needs to tell him this is crap and dated .
" i like moose but he should stop bitching about the thor pitch . fuck escobar , that's one way to get him back o stop swinging at the 1st pitch "
well now all the pre-teen aged girls who were thinking of paying money to go watch thor or kong at the movies are going to have 2nd thoughts

alright if you hate briana ok but like just ignore her don't call her names just leave her be if we ignore this it may just leave
unless briana was as virgin- the only thing i can tell <user> is dna test ! she wouldn't be the 1st trying 2 trap a celebrity ...
just saying briana got pregnant when she had a bf in march/april and louis and eleanor had just broken up isn't that just fishy
ok but louis hasnt been seen with briana since like what march ???? he is never with her and he looks so uncomfortable when interviewers+
" paps : this one if for the sun !! briana : * stands behind louis and poses * so not set up , nope nope nope , not one bit "
in the paparazzi video where they take cliche for the sun you can clearly see louis not realising that there's briana behind him
briana may be pregnant but louis isnt the dad or atleast he is not excited about it you can obviously see it when he's been asked about it
so briana is allowed to smoke but not allowed to take photos by fans because it may affect the baby okay then .

funny corbyn worries innocent people may be killed in syrian war but doesn't care about the people the ira killed <url>
<user> <user> part of me suspects corbyn may march on his own party hq with stw & blame it on tony blair . you never know .
<user> yo dicko !! it was pure sectarian bigotry from the ira councillor which started this in the 1st place !!
<user> <user> no the ira grew out of oppression & internment & bloody sunday & ballymurphy & kids killed by rubber bullets &
if tony blair pipes up tomorrow someone shoot him . actually maybe he should and that will turn the vote !
<user> but the point is that corbyn's sympathy for ira is not relevant in deciding whether to vote same way as him tomorrow
